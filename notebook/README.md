# Notebooks Overview
This folder contains all analytical notebooks developed for the NorthStar Urban Mobility and Logistics Analytics Project. Each notebook focuses on a specific stage of the data analysis and system development process.

# Notebook Structure
1. 01_sql_in_r.ipynb
This notebook uses SQL queries executed within R (via the sqldf package) to analyse structured operational data.
It focuses on identifying key issues such as delivery failures, delays, and performance differences across hubs and zones.

2. 02_r_analytics.ipynb
This notebook performs statistical analysis and data manipulation using dplyr, along with visualisation using ggplot2.
It uncovers patterns and trends that are not easily visible through SQL queries alone.

3. 03_python_processing.ipynb
This notebook handles data processing, transformation, and additional analysis using Python.
It is used for cleaning, preparing datasets, and generating insights through Python-based tools and visualisations.

4. 04_mongodb_development.ipynb
This notebook focuses on designing and implementing a MongoDB Atlas NoSQL database.
It models complex, semi-structured data such as complaints, delivery incidents, and app events using document-based structures.

# Purpose
The notebooks together provide a complete analytics workflow, combining:

SQL-based querying
Statistical analysis
Data processing
NoSQL database design
This integrated approach supports better understanding of operational inefficiencies and enables data-driven decision-making for NorthStar.

# Tools & Technologies
R (sqldf, dplyr, ggplot2)
Python
MongoDB Atlas
Google Colab

# Notes
All datasets are loaded from Google Drive or the /data folder.
Each notebook is designed to be run independently but contributes to the overall analysis.
